Dear Member,

My name is {{ $name }}, and I am a member of the Freecycle Spam Control Team,
working to protect members like you from scams and spam.

A post you responded to may violate the Terms of Service for the Freecycle Network.
We believe that it was posted as an "OFFER" with the title "{{ $item }}" to your
local TFN Town group and you replied to the offer on or about {{ $date }}.
Please be assured that you did nothing wrong by replying to this post.

We strongly urge you not to pay any money for an item, or for delivery of the
item whether it be via courier, cash, bank transfer or vouchers, as you may
never receive the item offered. Please be cautious with posts that may seem
"too good to be true." We recommend avoiding further contact with the user
that made this post, particularly outside of The Freecycle Network.

If at any time in the future you see what you believe to be a scam type post,
or you receive a response that you believe may be a violation of the Terms of
Service, please contact your local moderating team: go to https://freecycle.org,
and click on the My Towns link at the top of the page. On a phone, click the
Menu (3 horizontal lines) and select My Towns, then click on the name of the
Town and use the Message Moderators button at the top of the Town page.

As we take user privacy seriously this message serves as your assurance that
we will complete our investigation and take appropriate action as necessary.
Due to privacy concerns, we cannot provide additional details.

Kind regards,
{{ $name }}
